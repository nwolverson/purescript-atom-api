Atom API bindings for PureScript

## Status

These bindings are still very incomplete and not ready for general consumption.

The plan is to implement enough functionality from the [Atom API](https://atom.io/docs/api/v0.106.0/api/) so that it is feasible to build non-trivial PureScript-based atom packages.

Once these bindings are usable in some minimal fashion they will be showcased in [atom-package-purescript](https://github.com/darinmorrison/atom-package-purescript).
